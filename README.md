# Horiseon-optimization
Week-1 HW#1
This HW assignment is to improve the website usage for all users including people with dissability by adding necessary
    information to the source code. With this method, someone with dissability still could access the code and understand
    on how the code works to build the entire website.

There are several things that need to be fixed in order to be user friendly for all of the people.
Things that I changed while working on this HW were listed as below:

    1. Scan and identify the HTML and cSS code that need to be modified
    2. Re-style the identation of the code in HTML to make the user easy to read the code
    3. Delete the redundacies code in CSS 
    4. Change the non-semantic elements to semantic
    5. Add some missing command in the HTML
